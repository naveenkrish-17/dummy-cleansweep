My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \n\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \n\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \n\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \n\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.   \n\nThey keep moving.   \n\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \n\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \n\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \n\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters."
